**Hello!**
*Welcome to my user page!*
I'm Ben, a CS major at UCSD. To skip straight to learning more about my work, click [here](#my-work). 

##About Me
I've been interested in computer science since I was 12, being introduced to it by tinkering with mods for PC games with my friends. Since then, I've been studying it at UC San Diego, where I also work in student government and participate in martial arts. At home, I spend my time playing the guitar, playing and modding PC games, and cooking. You can find me on Facebook [here](https://www.facebook.com/ben.lonc.549/). I was convinced that UCSD computer science was right for me when one of my professors included in his lecture that: 
>After class, I'm going out to get chicky tendies. 

##My Work
###Triton Prosthetics 
I've been a member of the engineering team with Triton Prosthetics since October of 2020, where I have worked on a computerised prosthetic hand that is controlled by the movement of the user's arm. I mainly work on signal processing and controls. 

###Personal Projects
I have given myself challenges to allow myself to experiment with concepts I have yet to learn and to synthesise what I have covered in previous coursework. An example of some quick code I put together for a personal experiment can be found [here](/autoChess.c). While I still stand by this code, it is quite old and I find that there is room for improvement in retrospect: 
- It is not very self-documenting 
- It is not very well-designed algorithmically 
- It could leverage object-oriented design better
- Certain decisions made in the interest of experimentation actually introduced deprecated keywords into my code, namely the `register` keyword

###Academic Progress
As I progress through my academic career, the decisions I make and the software I build will become better through experience and education. So far, I have taken:
- [x] OOP
- [x] Data Structures
- [x] Algorithms 
- [ ] Software Engineering 
- [ ] Compilers 
- [ ] Machine Learning
